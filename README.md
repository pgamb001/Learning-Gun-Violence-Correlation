# Learning-Gun-Violence-Correlation
Collected data from gun violence record sources and used a classifier to determine 
correlation between shootings and mental health issues. Ran multiple classifiers like 
bagging, regression and decision tree andclustering algorithms like hierarchical, 
cobweb and kmeans. Predicition accuracy of 91% for race of shooter using decision tree 
classifier and 85% using one class SVM classifier for Outliers. Used Java Spark for 
preprocessing and Weka, sklearn for clustering.

In the recent aftermath of the numerous high school shootings wherein many students were
killed and several injured, firearm ownership has become a very polarizing topic. We collect
data from a number of sources that maintain gun violence records and try to find insights
from the data. We source our data from the Stanford Mass Shootings project, Mother Jones
information website, and the gun violence archive. We will try to find if there are location
patterns in mass shootings, if gun laws, literacy rate, average income, race, location have a
correlation with shootings.
